# Mastering-SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases.
Enables Python developers to create applications that communicate to different database engines through the same API.

We can divide SQLAlchemy architecture into 3 parts:

    - SQLAlchemy ORM
    - SQLAlchemy Core
    - DB API defined in PEP 249 of Python

## Data modeling with SQLAlchemy

1. Creating the project structure
2. Creating the models
3. Creating the tables in the database

## Manipulating data with SQLAlchemy

1. Understanding the unit of work pattern

6. Updating datas - Update
7. Deleting datas - Delete
